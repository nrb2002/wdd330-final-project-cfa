# wdd330-final-project-cfa
This CFA (College For All) project’s purpose is to standardize college applications accross different schools. 

W04: Final Project - Proposal
Overview
Purpose
The CFA (College For All) project’s purpose is to standardize college applications in the Democratic Republic of the Congo by making life easier for both local colleges and prospective students. The system will increase the reach and accessibility of local schools during the admission period. Knowing that colleges are overcrowded every year during the admission period, it will make life easier for distant and international students and save them from wasting their energy, time and resources with in-person visits to campuses.
Audience
Our audience is made of higher education schools and prospective students who intend to study in the DR Congo.  
Major Functions
The application builds up on more than one form and meets the complexity corresponding the time available between now and the end of the block. It includes a combination of static and dynamically generated markup, and uses animation.

•	Landing Page
•	Login page
•	User Dashboard
•	User Profile
